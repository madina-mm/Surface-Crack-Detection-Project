# Surface-Crack-Detection

This repository contains a group project that is about surface crack detection. The goal is to build models to identify cracks of the surfaces by using image classification. Two CNN architectures, ResNet18 and VGG16 are used. The models will be trained on the training set using the cross-entropy loss function and optimizers named SGD and Adam.
